## Greetings!

I am **IntangibleMatter**, a game developer working primarily with Godot, but I love learning new engines, frameworks, and whatever else I can that seems cool or useful.

- he/him, but whatever is chill
- currently working on my first major game
- learning basically everything I can, but currently C++, Wren, Rust, and how to use Linux.
- FOSS FTW
- Check out my website! [IntangibleMatter.net](https://intangiblematter.net/)
